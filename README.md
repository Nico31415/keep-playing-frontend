# keep-playing-frontend

In this project we had to design and implement a solution to a real-world problem following the principles of agile development and human centred design. The problem solution had to involve a digital touch-point in the form of a multi-user web or mobile application and had to involve real-time user interactions to maintain a consistent internal state via use of a server side database.



This repository contains the frontend part of our code, you can find the backend part at keep-playing.
